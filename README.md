# silverorange Frontend Developer Exercise

This exercise is designed to assess how you approach tasks representative of
the front-end developer role at silverorange. We are as interested in your
process as we are in the final results. **Please use descriptive Git commit
messages, and include comments where you think your code may be unclear.**

## 1 - Update Existing Page

With the provided static page in the `/existing-page` folder, make the following
changes. No mockups are provided, use your judgement and the base styles
provided in `style.css`. The implementation should use
[newly available baseline support](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/):

1. Move the main and aside content into a two-column layout at larger screen
   sizes. At a minimum, the aside content should be 300px wide and the main
   content should be 500px wide. The footer should always remain at the bottom
   of the viewport.

2. Move _Show more information_ section into a modal. Use accent colors to
   style the trigger for this modal, which should have accessible name
   _Show more information_.

**BONUS**: add light/dark mode (according to system or user agent-level preference)

## 2 - Build Out New Page

Using the provided Vite application base in the `/new-page` folder, implement
the page from the Figma file sent to you via email.

If you create a free Figma account, you’ll have access to export assets and
inspect details in the mockup.

For this exercise we are just interested in replicating the visual appearance
of the mockup—**no functionality is required**. [Widely available baseline support](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/) is expected.

A basic responsive template is included in the project to get you started.

If you are comfortable with React and Typescript, you can split the page into components, but
this is not a requirement.

### Running and Testing the New Page

```sh
cd new-page/
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The page will hot-reload as you save changes.

## Environment

For this exercise, Vite requires Node.js version 20.19+, 22.12+.
